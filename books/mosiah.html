  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Now this was done because there were so many people</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Therefore they <span class="swap" data-orig="did assemble" data-mod="assembled">did assemble</span> themselves together in different bodies<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">neither would they join the church<span class="punct">.</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And they were a separate people as to their faith<span class="punct">,</span> and remained so ever after<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">they were not half so numerous as the people of God<span class="punct">;</span></span>
