  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">took courage to go forth <span class="swap" data-orig="unto" data-mod="to">unto</span> the Lamanites</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And assuredly it was great<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Thus they were a very indolent people<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Therefore they separated themselves one from another<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and went forth among them<span class="punct">,</span> every man alone<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">according to the word and power of God which was given <span class="swap" data-orig="unto" data-mod="to">unto</span> him<span class="punct">.</span></span>

<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="font-size: 0.6em; color: #666; margin-right: 3px; vertical-align: super;">17:19</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">the Lamanites took him and bound him<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and carry them before the king<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to <span class="swap" data-orig="slay" data-mod="kill">slay</span> them<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">or to retain them in captivity<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael<span class="punct">;</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And the king inquired of Ammon</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">if it were his desire to dwell in the land</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and caused that his bands should be loosed<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and he would that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife<span class="punct">.</span></span>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="font-size: 0.6em; color: #666; margin-right: 3px; vertical-align: super;">17:25</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni<span class="punct">.</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Now the Nephites greatly feared</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">for he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">by any other way save by the entrance<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">because of the highness of the bank which had been thrown up<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">but behold<span class="punct">,</span> they were driven back from time to time<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">they began to dig down their banks of earth</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">he caused that a search should be made among his men<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">that perhaps he might find a man</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And it came to pass that they found one<span class="punct">,</span> whose name was Laman<span class="punct">;</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">therefore Moroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And when it was evening</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Laman went to the guards who were over the Nephites<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine<span class="punct">;</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">But behold<span class="punct">,</span> this was not the desire of Moroni<span class="punct">;</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">But he had obtained his desires<span class="punct">;</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Now behold this was done in the night-time<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">But I would not suffer them</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And now these are the cities of</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city<span class="punct">.</span></span>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="font-size: 0.6em; color: #666; margin-right: 3px; vertical-align: super;">56:16</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;"><span class="swap" data-orig="Yea" data-mod="Indeed">Yea</span><span class="punct">,</span> and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and thus they had suffered great <span class="swap" data-orig="afflictions" data-mod="hardships">afflictions</span> of every kind<span class="punct">.</span></span>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="font-size: 0.6em; color: #666; margin-right: 3px; vertical-align: super;">56:17</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">therefore you may well suppose</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">that this little force which I brought with me<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And now it came to pass that</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength to his army<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And thus were we favored of the Lord<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">for had they come upon us in this our weakness</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">they might have perhaps destroyed our little army<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">but thus were we preserved<span class="punct">.</span></span>

<div style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><span style="font-size: 0.6em; color: #666; margin-right: 3px; vertical-align: super;">56:20</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">They were commanded by Ammoron</span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">to maintain those cities which they had taken<span class="punct">.</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And thus ended the twenty and sixth year<span class="punct">.</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us<span class="punct">;</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">to watch the movements of the Lamanites<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">that they might not pass us by night nor by day</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">therefore we were desirous<span class="punct">,</span> if they should pass by us<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">to fall upon them in their rear<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">at the same time they were met in the front<span class="punct">.</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">We supposed that we could overpower them<span class="punct">;</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And thus<span class="punct">,</span> with their forces<span class="punct">,</span> they were determined</span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">And now it came to pass in the second month of this year<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">and provisions arrive for our support<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">they began to be fearful<span class="punct">,</span> and began to sally forth<span class="punct">,</span></span>

  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise<span class="punct">,</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them<span class="punct">;</span></span>
  <span style="display: block; margin-left: 0;">therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth</span>
